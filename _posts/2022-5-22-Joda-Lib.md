title:  "How Joda Date library helped with every Date utilities, when we still had to support < Java 8"
tags: Android targetSdk Date Joda

Why Joda?
> Joda-Time provides a quality replacement for the Java date and time classes.
> The standard date and time classes prior to Java SE 8 are poor. By tackling this problem head-on, Joda-Time became the de facto standard date and time library for Java prior to Java SE 8.
> From Java SE 8 onwards, users are asked to migrate to java.time (JSR-310).
Our project minSdk is set to 23 (Android 6/7)which continue to use older Java APIs.
Joda solves the problem of providing one set of APIs which can be used across all OS versions.

Add the dependency
```
implementation 'net.danlew:android.joda:2.10.14'
```

Get date in the time zone
```
val zone: DateTimeZone = DateTimeZone.forID(timezoneId)
```

From Unix to human readable date at given timezone.

```
val zone: DateTimeZone = DateTimeZone.forID(timezoneId)
return DateTime(receivedTime * 1000L, zone)
```
		
Manipulate current time to trigger an alarm
```
var triggerTime = date.plusHours(notificationCount).plusMinutes(totalDelay).withSecondOfMinute(0).withMillisOfSecond(0)
```
		 
If device is in different time zone, convert to device time zone
```
var deviceTime = triggerTime.withZone(DateTimeZone.getDefault())	
```

Convert the device time to Calender object to pass it to AlarmManager
```
val time = deviceTime.toGregorianCalendar()
```
					
Use this time to pass it to Alarm methods
```
alarmManager.setAlarmClock(
AlarmManager.AlarmClockInfo(time, pendingIntent),
pendingIntent)
```

For Unit testing:
testCompile 'joda-time:joda-time:2.10.14'
